# Beginners Guide to Supervised Machine Learning
Notes from [pynash talk](http://www.meetup.com/PyNash/events/234643746/)

## Abstract of Talk

Wherever you turn these days someone is talking about machine learning. The Python community is lucky to have scikit-learn (one of, if not the, best libraries for creating and training models and predicting outcomes). In her talk, Beck will focus on how scikit-learn can be used for supervised machine learning tasks such as classification and regression. She will give a brief overview of machine learning terms and examples of how to use scikit-learn to start becoming familiar with machine learning.
